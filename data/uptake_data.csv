What you’re struggling about might be something someone else is.  So let’s say we solve the problem and then Student E gets something wrong, and she says, ""Oh my goodness.

Student M, can you flick that first light on for me?  We’ve been spending quite a bit of time over these last two weeks talking about fractions.  We’ve simplified fractions.  We’ve made equivalent fractions.  We’ve added and subtracted fractions, oh, and we’ve multiplied fractions too.  You’re probably sick of fractions. They’re probably coming to of your ears, but there are still more things we can do with fractions.  We still have to learn how to divide the fractions, and today we’re going to look at how fractions and decimals relate.  How do fractions and decimals relate, Student N?  Your essential question is how do fractions and decimals relate?  Turn to a clean page in your math journal, and write that down.  Okay. Now raise your hand if you like money.  I knew it, everybody.
